                But I have no idea how to change myself anymore. I have tried willpower and it just does not work. It's not a good solution. I see now that I need to change the way I think.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How do I do that?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Maybe I should start with what I know about my beliefs. 
                
                <br><br>
                                
                What do I believe to be true? That's a tough one. How do I recognize whether I believe something to be true? How do I know that I'm not just pretending? I have learned that there is a big difference between wanting to believe something and actually acting out the beliefs. That's why I don't think thoughts or feelings are very reliable. How would someone separate thought from feeling? That's very tricky. I often can't.  
                
                <br><br>
                
                Well if I can't rely on my thoughts or feelings to say anything concrete about my beliefs, then perhaps my actions would reveal something about my truths? At least to some extent. So the next question is "How can I verbalize my truths according to my actions?" I would think that clear and simple observation is necessary. By simple, I mean honest and straightforward. It is very important here to be honest with myself. Even if I'm embarrased by what I do.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Let's say I binge watch romantic comedies or tv-shows whenever I feel I have some time for myself (true btw). What does this say about my beliefs? I'm going to start very simple: I think it's fair to say that I like romantic comedies.  I could deduct that romance is important to me. I value good romance. I'm going to make a list here.
            </p>

            <h3>My beliefs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I value romance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                That is something I could also deduct by acknowledging the fact that I have been in a romantic relationship since I was 12. There were few months here and there when I was between relationships. But only 3 or 4 times. So it is evident from two instances already that I value romantic relationships - romance.
            </p>

            <p>
                What else? I could list all the things I do.

                <br><br>
